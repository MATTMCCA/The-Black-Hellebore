# The Black Hellebore

### The Black Hellebore, RK61 PCB (Clone)

What to do with the most popular keyboard on amazon? Reverse engineer! it obviously! New and more better, QMK powered PCB for the RK61. Uses actual STM32 not a cloned Sonix IC.
 
Hardware is a WIP, I have yet to Fab the PCB. 

* CC1 & CC2 Resistors should be 1% not 5%.
* I really hope I got the swutch spacing and PCB size correct!! (spoiler, it wasn't, but its been fixed)
* Prototype has split BOM, PCB will come partially assembled.
